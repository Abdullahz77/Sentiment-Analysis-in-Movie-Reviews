"You know a lot people say this about a ton of different shows but Game of Thrones is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best TV shows ever created...it's damn near perfect (except for maybe the last few episodes of the last season) and easily one of my all-time favorite shows!",Positive,2
"Yeah, the last few episodes of Season 8 weren't that good and the ending was just awful but the first 7 1/2 seasons were so amazing that it still gets a 10 from me!",Positive,2
It's one of the rare shows where I can watch it all the way from the first episode to the last and never get bored.,Positive,2
I'm pretty sure there's never been a show more talked about or more loved in the history of television than GOT.,Positive,2
All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is!,Positive,2
It's absolutely terrible.,Negative,2
